This was the original version of my personal blog. I have decided to move from [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). I have decided to keep the Jekyll version of my blog around in this repo for posterity. The up-to-date version of my blog can be found [here](https://github.com/tmr08c/tmr08c.github.io/).

# TroyProg Blog

Personal site and blog using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Development

You can run the server locally, with live reloading, with the following:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
```

## Deployment

GitHub Pages will automatically build and server the site when pushed to `master`.
